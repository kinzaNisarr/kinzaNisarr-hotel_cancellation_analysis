Analyze hotel booking data to identify factors influencing cancellation rates. Build a predictive model to reduce cancellations, optimize pricing &amp; improve revenue generation. Python &amp; Data Science project.

**Overview**
This repository contains a Python and Data Science project focused on analyzing hotel booking data to understand the factors influencing hotel cancellation rates. The project involves data exploration, cleaning, visualization, feature engineering, and building a predictive model. The ultimate goal is to provide insights and recommendations to reduce cancellations, optimize pricing, and improve revenue generation for both City Hotel and Resort Hotel.

**Techniques Used****
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data patterns, trends, and relationships.
2. Data Cleaning to handle missing values, drop irrelevant columns, and transform data types.
3. Data Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn for graphical representation of findings.
4. Feature Engineering to create new relevant features for analysis and modeling.
5. Predictive Modeling using Decision Tree Classifier to predict cancellation probability.
6. Model Evaluation to assess the performance and accuracy of the predictive model.

**Findings**
1. Cancellation Rate: City Hotel has a higher cancellation rate compared to Resort Hotel.
2. Booking Trend: Bookings have increased over the years, with peaks in certain months.
3. Guest Origins: Majority of guests come from specific countries.
4. Accommodation Type: Couples and families are the most booked accommodation types.
5. Stay Duration: Most guests stay for short durations of 1-4 nights.

**Recommendations**
1. Implement strategies to reduce cancellations by analyzing pricing and promotional decisions.
2. Focus on peak booking months and adjust hotel operations accordingly.
3. Target marketing efforts towards countries with high guest origins.
4. Optimize room allocations and types based on booking trends and stay durations.
5. By following these recommendations, hotels can enhance their revenue generation and provide better guest experiences.
